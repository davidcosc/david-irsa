= IRSA

This repository contains documentation about "IAM Roles for Service Accounts" (IRSA). +
In short IRSA is a way to enable kubernetes to provision temporary, IAM role based aws credentials to individual pods. +
More information on IRSA can be found https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html[here].

== Benefits
- no permanent AWS credentials
- fine grained permissions for individual pods (least privilege, credential isolation)
- auditability (aws cloud trail acces and event logging)
- uses standard kubernetes features to achieve this
- uses standard OpenID Connect protocol (OIDC) for authentication

== Problems
- scalability (is expected to be improved in the second half of 2023 with a new version of IRSA)

== IRSA standards
- kubernetes https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/[dynamic admission control] with https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/[admission controllers]
- https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect]
- https://aws.amazon.com/de/iam/[AWS IAM]

== Generating the initial Service Account Token on the Kubernetes side
To understand how exactly the token used by the pod to request temporary credentials from aws is generated (*Figure 1 Step 1*), we first have to get some basic understanding of some of the inner workings of kubernetes. 

=== Kubernetes resource creation simplified

=== Pod Identity Webhook
During the resource creation process shown in *Figure 2*, it is possible to manipulate the resource definition before it is stored in etcd. To understand how this works we have to look at *Step 2* in *Figure 2* more closely. +
A resource creation request goes through several phases before the resource definition is actually stored in etcd. These phases can be seen in *Figure 3*. +

.Request Phases

We can use a webhook to manipulate resource definitions during the *mutating admission* phase. This is where the https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook[Amazon EKS Pod Identity Webhook] comes into play. +
The pod identity webhook is a https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/21/a-guide-to-kubernetes-admission-controllers/[mutating admission controller] that extends all pod definitions that contain annotations about an IAM role. An example of a pod definition that has been mutated by the webhook can be seen in *Figure 4*. +

.Extended Pod Definition

Note that part of the extended definition seen in *Figure 4* is the so called *aws-token*. It is a special service account token that the pod can exchange for temporary aws credentials with aws sts later on. +

=== Kubernetes Service Account Token Creation
To understand service account token creation, we have to take a look at *Figure 2 Step 4* / *Figure 1 Step 1* in more detail. This can be seen in *Figure 5*. +

=== Kubernetes, Service Account Tokens and OIDC
Now that we understand how service account tokens are created, we can take a look at some properties of service account tokens that come in handy in respect to OIDC. +

A kubernetes service account token is: +

- a JSON Web Token (JWT)
- can be configured to have OIDC conform claims like audience, issuer, subject
- is signed with a key that can be configured when starting kubernetes

== AWS Service Account Token Validation
The documentation for the https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook[Amazon EKS Pod Identity Webhook] shows how to configure token signing keys as well as the OIDC discovery endpoint on the AWS side. +
In simple terms we first generate a public/private key pair. We then configure kubernetes to use the private key for signing service account tokens. On the AWS side we configure a matching OIDC discovery endpoint using the respective public key. +
AWS can then use the OIDC discovery endpoints public key to validate respective service account tokens send to AWS by kubernetes pods. This happens in *Figure 1 Step 3*. +
If the signature validation is successfull, AWS then attempts to validate the claims contained inside the token. +
Validation is done by checking, that the tokens claims match the expected claims configured for the IAM Role and webidentity. +
